            Persuader: It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.
            Persuadee: Oh yeah! Many people should be like that
            Persuader: Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.
            Persuadee: How many people are currently donating?
            Persuader: 42% of their funding is from US. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources. You can get further details from  URL
            Persuadee: Oh OK! I will look into that. So what do I need to donate?
            Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
            Persuadee: Ok cool! It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause
            Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.
